# GSE217195 – MOLM-13 Bulk RNA-seq Analysis

This repository contains a **reproducible and literature-aligned exploratory transcriptomics analysis** based on the public GEO dataset **GSE217195**, focusing on the human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line **MOLM-13**.

The project is prepared directly for **GitHub sharing**, with clear scope definition, transparent assumptions, and explicit limitations.

## Dataset

* **GEO accession:** GSE217195
* **Repository:** NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
* **Organism:** *Homo sapiens*
* **Cell line:** MOLM-13 (acute myeloid leukemia)
* **Link:** [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE217195)
* **PMID:** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38413714

Raw data are accessed from GEO and are **not redistributed** in this repository.

---

## Methodological Principles

* No artificial sample groupings are introduced
* Results are interpreted at the level of **patterns and trends**, not statistical causality
* Thresholds and preprocessing decisions are explicitly stated

These choices align with recommendations in current transcriptomics literature.
